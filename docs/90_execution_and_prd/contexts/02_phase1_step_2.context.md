# Phase 1 — Step 2: Core Objectives

## Goal
Translate Phase 1 scope into measurable objectives and operational KPIs for validation.

## Objectives
- Reduce manual lead-to-agent assignment effort for managers
- Improve consistency of assignments through explicit rules
- Provide full explainability per recommendation
- Maintain manager control and auditability

## KPIs (Phase 1 Validation Targets)
- % of leads receiving a recommendation successfully
- % of recommendations approved vs overridden
- Time-to-assignment (manager workflow)
- Data ingestion freshness / error rate
- Explainability coverage (every score has rule contribution)

## Inputs
- Step 1 scope statement
- PRD goals and non-goals

## Outputs
- KPI definitions + how to measure them from logs
- Testable success criteria for end-to-end demo

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each objective maps to at least one metric/log
- KPIs can be measured from Phase 1 logs without external tools

## Cursor Instructions
- Do not invent new product goals; keep aligned with PRD
